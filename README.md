# Learning-unity-developement
-14th.Feb.2025 ~ 17th.Feb.2025 : Started watching YouTube tutorial video from 'Nomad Coder'.
  It's mainly about following every step and making the duplicate of 'Kimchi-Run'.
  I didn't really know about Unity engine and C# language, so I just decided to learn by 'Learn by doing' method.
  The language itself had some similarities with the C language which I learned from the last semester's class.
  And the Unity engine's UI was not that familiar, but for some reasons it reminded me of Cinema4D's UI.
